% Allegro changelog for 4.9.x series

See `changes._tx` for changes in earlier versions of Allegro.  These lists
serve as summaries; the full histories are in the Subversion repository.



Changes from 4.9.2 to 4.9.3 (April 2008)
========================================

Graphics:

-  Milan Mimica did lots of work on the OpenGL drivers, such as adding an
   OpenGL driver for Windows and making the OpenGL code shared between
   platforms.

-  Peter Hull added an OpenGL graphics driver for Mac OS X.

-  Milan Mimica made the OpenGL driver share contexts between displays.

-  Peter Wang and Milan Mimica made the OpenGL driver work with cards that
   don't support non-power-of-two (NPOT) textures.

-  Trent Gamblin added support for NPOT textures in the Direct3D driver.

-  Trent Gamblin fixed blending in memory drawing functions. 

-  Trent Gamblin added al_draw_pixel() which obeys blending.

-  Trent Gamblin made al_clear() not affected by blending in D3D.

-  Milan Mimica added the following functions to the public API:
   al_opengl_version(), al_is_opengl_extension_supported(),
   al_get_opengl_proc_address(), al_get_opengl_extension_list().

-  Milan Mimica added sub-bitmaps support for memory bitmaps and in the
   OpenGL display driver.

-  Milan Mimica made displays keep a list of bitmaps. When destroying a
   display its bitmaps will be managed properly, e.g. converted to memory
   bitmaps if necessary. All display bitmaps will be automatically destroyed
   on exit.

-  Peter Wang made X window resizing work without GLX 1.3.

-  Trent Gamblin fixed a bug in the Direct3D driver when windows were
   minimized (thanks to David McCallum).

   style.

Fonts:

-  Milan Mimica made font drawing faster, by making glyphs sub-bitmaps of a
   larger glyph sheet.

-  Milan Mimica and Peter Wang made font loading faster.

-  Trent Gamblin added versions of text output functions which take as an
   explicit argument the length of the strings.

Audio:

-  A new audio API implementation, originally by Chris Robinson, was added
   (currently as an addon only).  It has received additional work in the past
   from Milan Mimica and recently much work from Ryan Dickie.

-  Ryan Dickie also added an acodec addon, which has loaders for FLAC, Wave
   and Ogg Vorbis files, using other libraries.

Timers:

-  Ryan Dickie changed the type of timestamps throughout the API from int
   expressed in milliseconds to double expressed in seconds and improved
   timer resolution on Windows.

-  Ryan Dickie added an 'error' field to the timer event, and added error
   and overhead statistics to exnew_timer.

-  Trent Gamblin made the Windows timer use QueryPerformanceCounter.

-  Peter Wang split al_wait_for_event() into two functions, a version that
   takes a timeout and a version that doesn't.

-  Trent Gamblin merged the Windows and Unix timer source files.

Input:

-  Peter Wang renamed some joystick and timer functions to adhere to the
   `al_<verb>_<noun>` convention.

-  Peter Wang made al_num_joysticks() more lenient if there is no joystick
   driver installed.

Other:

-  David Capello added support for various different BMPs.

-  Elias Pschernig fixed compilation of the X port in case the XVidMode
   extension is unavailable (thanks to Thomas Fjellstrom).

-  Elias Pschernig added a exnew_timer example.

-  Trent Gamblin added exnew_multiwin and exnew_drawpixels.

   events and event sources to NaturalDocs.

   and al_event_source_mask which were missed in the previous change.

   the user to prevent an event source from generating particular
   event types. This was implemented using bitfields which limited the
   number of event types to 32. Although the limit could be raised
   event masking was probably not very useful anyway. In all, the
   functions removed are: al_event_source_mask, al_event_source_set_mask,
   al_wait_for_specific_event. The al_wait_for_specific_event() API also
   required event types to be bitfields.

   and an LL suffix into a (LONG_LONG) cast, both for MSVC 6.

-  Matthew Leverton submitted a fix for MSVC 6 regarding MSVC's

   should not be used by users any more. Added a comment that it is used by
   zipup.sh.

-  Anthony 'Timorg' Cassidy made d_menu_proc fill up its assigned
   area with the gui_bg_color.

   generation system. The documentation is nowhere near as good as a proper
   manual, but it's still better than nothing.

-  Added CMake and SCons build systems. These are mainly for use by Allegro
   developers at present.

-  Various bug fixes and minor changes.



Changes from 4.2 series to 4.9.0 (July 2006)
============================================

*Note that 4.9.0 was called 4.3.0 when it was originally released.*

Basically we're just wrapping up what we have in version control up to
now.  See the commit logs if you want details.

This release introduces a few new subsystems.  We have an event system, a
new keyboard API, a new joystick API, a new timer API, and the start of a
new graphics API.  All of these are subject to change, as is usual for
a WIP.

We are maintaining a certain level of source compatibility with the 4.2
API.  If it's easy to maintain compatibility then we do it, otherwise
compatibility is dropped.  Obscure features are more likely to be dropped.

This release has had minimal testing on Linux/x86, Windows/x86 (MinGW) and
Windows/x86 (MSVC).  It seems to work on some Linux/x86-64 machines also.
Other ports are broken or untested.

The new functions are as follows (in no particular order).  No real
documentation exists at the moment but interesting header files
are: altime.h, display.h, draw.h, events.h, joystick.h, keyboard.h,
timer.h.

-  al_current_time al_rest

-  al_create_video_bitmap al_create_system_bitmap al_scroll_display
   al_request_scroll al_poll_scroll al_show_video_bitmap
   al_request_video_bitmap al_enable_triple_buffer al_create_display
   al_set_update_method al_destroy_display al_flip_display al_get_buffer
   al_get_update_method al_enable_vsync al_disable_vsync al_toggle_vsync
   al_vsync_is_enabled al_blit al_blit_region al_blit_scaled

-  al_event_source_set_mask al_event_source_mask

-  al_create_event_queue al_destroy_event_queue al_register_event_source
   al_unregister_event_source al_event_queue_is_empty al_get_next_event
