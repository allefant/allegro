Changes from 5.1.1 to 5.1.2 (May 2012)
======================================

The main developers this time were: Thomas Fjellstrom, Trent Gamblin,
Elias Pschernig, Peter Wang.

Core:

-  Add userdata to Windows window callbacks and rename the functions
   (Matthew Leverton).

-  Fix ALLEGRO_STATIC_ASSERT collisions from different files included in the
   same translation unit.  Reported by tobing.

-  Make al_ustr_empty_string const correct.

-  Fix many memory leak/warnings on MacOS X (Pär Arvidsson).

Filesystem:

-  Make stdio al_fopen implementation set proper errno on failure.

-  Make al_get_standard_path(ALLEGRO_TEMP_PATH) treat environment values
   as directory names even without a trailing slash on Unix.

-  Fix typo preventing get_executable_name from using System V procfs
   correctly.  Reported by Max Savenkov.

Displays:

-  Fixed bug on Windows where two SWITCH_IN events were fired when window was
   minimized/restored (Michael Swiger).

-  Fixed inverted al_toggle_display_flag(ALLEGRO_NOFRAME) logic under Windows
   as well as a bug where repeatedly setting the flag to on would make the
   window grow bigger and bigger (Michael Swiger).

-  Fixed inverted al_toggle_display_flag(ALLEGRO_NOFRAME) logic in X11.

-  Rename al_toggle_display_flag to al_set_display_flag, retaining
   the older name for compatibility.

-  Add ALLEGRO_FRAMELESS as a preferred synonym for the confusing
   ALLEGRO_NOFRAME flag.

-  Set WM_NAME for some window managers (X11).

-  Disable the idle timer on iOS (screen lock) when entering airplay mode.

-  Make al_destroy_display handle display disconnection properly.
   The user will need to clean up then call al_destroy_display after receiving
   ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_DISCONNECTED (iOS).

Graphics:

-  Added al_get_parent_bitmap (Paul Suntsov).

-  Make blitting from backbuffer work when using multisampling on Windows/D3D.

-  Redefine pixel format LUMINANCE_8 as SINGLE_CHANNEL_8.

-  Map SINGLE_CHANNEL_8 to red channel only.  Fix some software pixel format
   conversion bugs previously present with the LUMINANCE_8 format.

-  Added al_create_custom_bitmap.

-  Remove ALLEGRO_PRESERVE_TEXTURE flag. The idea is to always preserve
   textures unless directed otherwise by the user with
   ALLEGRO_NO_PRESERVE_TEXTURE.

-  Added al_clear_depth_buffer and al_set_render_state functions.

-  Force al_create_bitmap to not create oversized bitmaps, to mitigate
   integer overflow problems.

-  Removed initial black frame on all Allegro programs.

OpenGL:

-  Fix null pointer dereference if backbuffer creation fails.
   Reported by Max Savenkov.

-  Made the ALLEGRO_OPENGL_FORWARD_COMPATIBLE flag work with al_draw_bitmap.

-  Texture should be 'complete' (min/mag and wrap set) before glTexImage2D.

-  Restore matrix manipulation code for unlocking backbuffer in GL <1.4 case.

-  Fixed a bug in al_unlock_bitmap where the pixel alignment mistakenly was
   used as row length.

-  Never set the projection when using programmable pipeline mode unless a
   program object is bound.

-  Do not preserve bound texture state.

-  Disable GL_NORMAL_ARRAY in non-programmable pipeline mode.

-  Fixed typo in names of some OpenGL extension functions.

-  Display list of OpenGL extensions in allegro.log also for OpenGL 3.0.

-  Check for OES_texture_npot as well for non-power-of-two support.

-  Fix loading of some textures on iOS.

Direct3D:

-  Fixed a bug in the D3D driver where separate alpha blending was being
   tested for when it shouldn't have been (Max Savenkov).

-  Do not manage depth stencil surface.

-  Arrange code so that sleep and hibernate work using the release and restore
   callbacks.

-  Fix device reset problem in D3D.

-  Make sub-bitmap restore properly on lost device.

Input:

-  Increase max number of joystick "sticks".  Due to analogue buttons being
   mapped to axes, the number of sticks on a single device may be much higher
   than expected.

-  Monitor /dev/input instead of /dev on Linux for hotplugging joysticks
   (Jon Rafkind).

-  Do not permanently change the locale for the X11 keyboard driver.
   Set LC_CTYPE only, not LC_ALL.

-  Update ALLEGRO_MOUSE_STATE even if mouse emulation event source isn't
   attached to an event queue (Android and iOS).

-  Don't report shakes at program start accidentally (iOS).

Android port:

-  Many graphics-related changes (too many to list).

-  Make Android port always choose a double buffered graphics mode.

-  Don't force 16-bit mode if no COLOR_SIZE specified.

-  Go fullscreen (no title/status bar).

-  Generate ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_HALT_DRAWING, RESUME_DRAWING events instead
   of SWITCH_IN/OUT.

-  Add an APK file driver for reading assets directly from Android app bundles.

-  Additions and fixes to accelerometer and orientation code.

-  Support for volume keys.

-  Added a dummy mouse driver, enough to get al_get_mouse_state working.

-  Improve compatibility of touch input emulation driver with iOS touch input
   emulation.

-  Add al_android_get_os_version().

-  Fix linking problem on Android 2.2 and below.

-  Update and clean up sample project.

Audio addon:

-  Fix desychronization due to inaccurate sample positions when resampling.
   Thanks to _Bnu for discovering the issue and Paul Suntsov for devising the
   correct solution.

-  Fix linear interpolation across audio stream buffer fragments.

-  Add stub OpenSL driver (Jon Rafkind).

-  Improve compatibility of BMP loader.  In particular, support bitmaps with
   V2-V5 headers and certain alpha bit masks.

-  Improve robustness of BMP loader against some corrupt files.

-  Fix TGA loader using more memory than necessary.  Reported by Max Savenkov.

-  Image loading in Android now works.

Font addon:

-  Use user set pixel format for fonts.

-  Added ALLEGRO_TTF_NO_AUTOHINT font loading flag to disable the Auto Hinter
   which is enabled by default in newer version of FreeType (Michał Cichoń).

   (jmasterx).

Primitives addon:

-  Use GL_REPEAT so textures can be tiled again.

-  Always set the texture due to missing glGetInteger on some GLES 1.0/1.1
   devices.

Build system:

-  Added OSX Framework support for the monolith library.

-  Make examples build with monolith build.

-  Add ex_resample_test.

-  Add ex_depth_mask.

-  ex_audio_props: Add bidir button.

-  ex_joystick_events: Support hotplugging and fix display of 3-axis sticks.

-  ex_polygon: Test al_draw_filled_polygon_with_holes.

-  Make .png and .tga loading tests to not require a backbuffer with an alpha
   channel.
