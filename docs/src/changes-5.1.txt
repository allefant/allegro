Changes from 5.0.x to 5.1.0 (November 2011)
===========================================

The main developers were: Michał Cichoń, Trent Gamblin, Matthew Leverton,
Elias Pschernig, Paul Suntsov, Peter Wang.

Core:

-  Added al_register_assert_handler.

-  Added API for registering callbacks to intercept window messages on Windows.

Graphics:

-  Added bitmap conversion API: al_convert_bitmap, al_convert_bitmaps, with
   bitmap flag ALLEGRO_CONVERT_BITMAP and display option
   ALLEGRO_AUTO_CONVERT_BITMAPS.  Automatic bitmap conversion is enabled by
   default.

-  Added al_draw_tinted_scaled_rotated_bitmap_region.

-  Added new ALLEGRO_PIXEL_FORMAT_LUMINANCE_8 format.

-  Added a new bitmap flag ALLEGRO_KEEP_INDEX.

-  Separate bitmap loader flags from bitmap flags.  This adds three functions:
   al_load_bitmap_flags, al_load_bitmap_flags_f and al_load_bitmap_font_flags.

-  Add ALLEGRO_SRC_COLOR, ALLEGRO_DST_COLOR blending modes (Jon Rafkind).

-  Add ALLEGRO_INVERSE_SRC_COLOR and ALLEGRO_INVERSE_DST_COLOR blending modes.

-  Made al_compose_transform do a full 3d multiply.

-  Added al_get_current_inverse_transform, al_ortho_transform,
   al_get_projection_transform, al_set_projection_transform.

-  Added al_reset_clipping_rectangle convenience function.

-  Added al_get_d3d_texture_size.

-  Added al_d3d_set_release_callback and al_d3d_set_restore_callback for
   release/restoring user d3d objects.

Displays:

-  Added al_get_display_orientation.

-  Added a new display option ALLEGRO_SUPPORTED_ORIENTATIONS to specify the
   supported orientations (default is just portrait as before).

-  Added al_change_display_option function, initially only for
   ALLEGRO_SUPPORTED_ORIENTATIONS.

-  Add two new display events (only implemented on iOS right now).
   ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_HALT_DRAWING tells the app to stop all drawing and
   ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_RESUME_DRAWING tells it it can start drawing again.
   SWITCH_OUT/IN on iOS were redefined from "going into/out of background" to
   "going active/inactive".

-  Added the function al_acknowledge_drawing_halt.

-  Added window size constraint functions (jmasterx).

Input:

-  Add API related to touch input.  The implementation covers iDevices and
   Windows 7 drivers for touch input.  A number of mouse emulation modes
   are provided.

Events:

-  Add al_pause_event_queue, al_is_event_queue_paused.

Filesystem:

-  Added al_fopen_slice.

-  Added al_set_exe_name which allows overriding Allegro's idea of the path
   to the current executable.

Audio addon:

-  Add mixer gain property and functions.

-  Add a 'global' audio event source, generating some audio events from the
   Audio Queues driver: AUDIO_ROUTE_CHANGE, AUDIO_INTERRUPTION,
   AUDIO_END_INTERRUPTION.

Native dialogs addon:

-  Add menus to native dialogs (Windows and GTK).

Primitives addon:

-  Add simple polygon triangulator and polygon drawing routines.

-  Added al_draw_polyline and al_draw_polyline_ex.

-  Added al_draw_filled_pieslice and al_draw_pieslice.

-  Added al_draw_elliptical_arc.

TTF addon:

-  Added al_load_ttf_font_stretch functions (tobing).

Shader addon:

-  Added a shader addon and programmable pipeline support.

Video addon:

-  Added a video player addon, currently using ffmpeg.

iOS port:

-  Added al_iphone_override_screen_scale, al_iphone_get_screen_scale,
   al_iphone_set_statusbar_orientation, al_iphone_get_last_shake_time,
   al_iphone_get_battery_level, al_iphone_get_window, al_iphone_get_view.

Examples:

-  Added new example programs: ex_audio_chain, ex_loading_thread, ex_menu,
   ex_palette, ex_polygon, ex_shader, ex_window_constraints, ex_video.
