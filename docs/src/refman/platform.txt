# Platform-specific functions

## Windows

These functions are declared in the following header file:

    #include <allegro5/allegro_windows.h>

### API: al_get_win_window_handle

Returns the handle to the window that the passed display is using.

## iPhone

These functions are declared in the following header file:

    #include <allegro5/allegro_iphone.h>

### API: al_iphone_program_has_halted

Multitasking on iOS is different than on other platforms. When an
application receives an ALLEGRO_DISPLAY_SWITCH_OUT or ALLEGRO_DISPLAY_CLOSE
event on a multitasking-capable device, it should cease all activity and
do nothing but check for an ALLEGRO_DISPLAY_SWITCH_IN event. To let the
iPhone driver know that you've ceased all activity, call this function.
You should call this function very soon after receiving the event telling
you it's time to switch out (within a couple milliseconds). Certain
operations, if done, will crash the program after this call, most notably any
function which uses OpenGL. This function is needed because the "switch out"
handler on iPhone can't return until these operations have stopped, or a
crash as described before can happen.

### API: al_iphone_override_screen_scale

Original iPhones and iPod Touches had a screen resolution of 320x480
(in Portrait mode). When the iPhone 4 and iPod Touch 4th generation devices
came out, they were backwards compatible with all old iPhone apps. This
means that they assume a 480x320 screen resolution by default, while they
actually have a 960x640 pixel screen (exactly 2x on each dimension). An
API was added to allow access to the full (or in fact any fraction of)
resolution of the new devices. This function is normally called with a value
of "2.0" to get the native iPhone 4 screen resolution (you must also call
al_create_display with (960, 640), AFTER calling this function). It is not
limited to 2.0 scaling factors however. You can use 1.5 or 0.5 or other values
in between, however if it's not an exact multiple of the original iPhone
resolution, linear filtering will be applied to the screen.
