# Native dialogs support

## API: ALLEGRO_NATIVE_FILE_DIALOG

Opaque handle to a native file dialog. You should only have one such
dialog opened at a time.

## API: al_create_native_file_dialog

Creates a new native file dialog.

Parameters:

- initial_path: The initial search path and filename. Can be NULL.
- title: Title of the dialog.
- patterns: A list of semi-colon separated patterns to match. You
  should always include the pattern "*.*" as usually the MIME type
  and not the file pattern is relevant. If no file patterns are
  supported by the native dialog, this parameter is ignored.
- mode: 0, or a combination of the flags below.

Possible flags for the 'mode' parameter are:

- ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_FILE_MUST_EXIST: If supported by the native dialog,
  it will not allow entering new names, but just allow existing files
  to be selected. Else it is ignored.
- ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_SAVE: If the native dialog system has a
  different dialog for saving (for example one which allows creating
  new directories), it is used. Else ignored.
- ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_FOLDER: If there is support for a separate
  dialog to select a folder instead of a file, it will be used.
- ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_PICTURES: If a different dialog is available
  for selecting pictures, it is used. Else ignored.
- ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_SHOW_HIDDEN: If the platform supports it, also
  hidden files will be shown.
- ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_MULTIPLE: If supported, allow selecting
  multiple files.

Returns:

A handle to the dialog which you can pass to
[al_show_native_file_dialog] to display it, and from which you then can
query the results. When you are done, call
[al_destroy_native_file_dialog] on it.

## API: al_show_native_file_dialog

This function completely blocks the calling thread until it returns,
so usually you may want to spawn a thread with [al_create_thread] and
call it from inside that thread.

## API: al_get_native_file_dialog_count

Returns the number of files selected, or 0 if the dialog was cancelled.

## API: al_get_native_file_dialog_path

Returns one of the selected pathes. 

## API: al_destroy_native_file_dialog

Frees up all resources used by the dialog.
