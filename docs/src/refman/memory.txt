# Memory

## API: al_set_memory_management_functions

Customise the memory management functions used by the library.
A default function will be used in place of any function pointer which is
NULL.
The default debug variants simply call the non-debug variants.

* malloc_atomic - malloc() replacement for objects not containing pointers
* user_opaque - will be passed through to all the functions above
