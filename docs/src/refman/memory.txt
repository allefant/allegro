# Memory

These functions are declared in the main Allegro header file:

    #include <allegro5/allegro.h>

## API: al_malloc

Like malloc() in the C standard library.  In the future we plan to allow the
user to customise the malloc/free functions used by Allegro, so it may hook
into another implementation.

## API: al_free

Like free() in the C standard library.  This is required because:

-  On Windows a memory block allocated by one DLL must be freed from the same
   DLL.  In the few places where an Allegro function returns a pointer that
   must be freed, you must use al_free() for portability to Windows.

-  In the future we plan to allow the user to customise the malloc/free
   functions used by Allegro, so it may hook into another implementation.
