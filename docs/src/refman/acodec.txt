# Audio Codec Loader

## API: al_register_sample_loader

Register a handler for [al_load_sample].  The given function will be used to
handle the loading of sample files with the given extension.

The extension should include the leading dot ('.') character.
It will be matched case-insensitively.

The `loader` argument may be NULL to unregister an entry.

Returns true on success, false on error.

## API: al_register_sample_saver

Register a handler for [al_save_sample].  The given function will be used to
handle the saving of sample files with the given extension.

The extension should include the leading dot ('.') character.
It will be matched case-insensitively.

The `saver` argument may be NULL to unregister an entry.

Returns true on success, false on error.

## API: al_register_stream_loader

Register a handler for [al_stream_from_file].  The given function will be
used to open streams from files with the given extension.

The extension should include the leading dot ('.') character.
It will be matched case-insensitively.

The `stream_loader` argument may be NULL to unregister an entry.

Returns true on success, false on error.

## API: al_load_sample

Loads a few different audio file formats based on their extension.
Some formats require external libraries to be installed prior to compiling
the library.

Note that this stores the entire file in memory at once, which
may be time consuming.  To read the file as it is needed, 
use [al_stream_from_file].

Returns the sample on success, NULL on failure.

## API: al_stream_from_file

Loads an audio file from disk as it is needed.

Unlike regular streams, the one returned by this function
need not be fed by the user; the library will automatically
read more of the file as it is needed.  The stream will 
contain *buffer_count* buffers with *samples* samples.

A stream must be attached to a voice to be used.  See
[ALLEGRO_STREAM] for more details.

Returns the stream on success, NULL on failure.

## API: al_save_sample

Writes a sample into a file.  Currently, wav is
the only supported format, and the extension
must be 'wav'.

Returns true on success, false on error.

## API: al_load_sample_wav

Load a sample from a PCM .wav file.

Returns the sample on success, NULL on failure.

See also: [al_load_sample_wav]

## API: al_save_sample_wav

Save a sample to a PCM .wav file.

Returns true on success, false on error.

See also: [al_save_sample], [al_save_sample_wav_pf]

## API: al_save_sample_wav_pf

Write a PCM .wav file into the [ALLEGRO_FILE] stream given.

Returns true on success, false on error.

See also: [al_save_sample], [al_save_sample_wav_pf]

## API: al_load_stream_wav

Like [al_stream_from_file] but assumes the file is PCM .wav file.
