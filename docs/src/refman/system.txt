## API: al_get_orgname

Returns the global organization name string.

## API: al_get_path

Gets a system path, ie: temp, home, etc

## API: al_install_system

been done already, al_uninstall_system() will be registered as an atexit
function.

## API: al_set_appname

Sets the global application name.

The Application name is used by [al_get_path] to build the full path to
an application's files.

Should be called once at the start of a program, before [al_init] or [al_install_system]
and never touched again.

## API: al_set_orgname

Sets the global organization name.

The Organization name is used by [al_get_path] to build the full path to
an application's files.

Should be called once at the start of a program, before [al_init] or [al_install_system]
and never touched again.

## API: al_system_driver

Returns the currently active_sysdrv system driver.

## API: al_uninstall_system

Closes down the Allegro system.

Note: al_uninstall_system() can be called without a corresponding
al_install_system() call, e.g. from atexit().
