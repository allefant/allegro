# Main addon

Main addon has no public API, but contains functionality that enables
code that uses Allegro to run without changes on all platforms Allegro supports.

On platforms that require this functionality (e.g. OSX) this addon contains the
C main function that calls [al_run_main] with the user's main function that had
its name mangled. This mangling is performed by macros included by the core library
header (`allegro5/allegro.h`), so it must be included it in the same file as 
the user's main function. If the main function is inside a C++ file, then the
main function must have this signature, `int main(int argc, char **argv)`, for
this addon to work.

On platforms that don't require this functionality, this addon does nothing,
but you should still keep it in mind in case you need to port to the platforms
that do require it.

Link with allegro_main.
