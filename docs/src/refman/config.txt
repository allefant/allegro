## API: ALLEGRO_CONFIG


## API: ALLEGRO_CONFIG_ENTRY


## API: ALLEGRO_CONFIG_SECTION


## API: al_add_config_comment

Add a comment in a section of a configuration.  If the section doesn't yet
exist, it will be created.
The section can be NULL or "" for the global section.

The comment may or may not begin with a hash character.
Any newlines in the comment string will be replaced by space characters.

## API: al_add_config_section

Add a section to a configuration structure.

## API: al_create_config

Create an empty configuration structure.

## API: al_destroy_config

Free the resources used by a configuration structure.
Does nothing if passed NULL.

## API: al_get_config_value

Gets a pointer to an internal character buffer that will only remain valid
as long as the ALLEGRO_CONFIG structure is not destroyed. Copy the value
if you need a copy.
The section can be NULL or "" for the global section.
Returns NULL if the section or key do not exist.

## API: al_merge_config

Merge two configuration structures, and return the result as a new
configuration.  Values in configuration 'cfg2' override those in 'cfg1'.
Neither of the input configuration structures are
modified.
Comments from 'cfg2' are not retained.

## API: al_merge_config_into

Merge one configuration structure into another.
Values in configuration 'add' override those in 'master'.
'master' is modified.
Comments from 'add' are not retained.

## API: al_load_config_file

Read a configuration file from disk.
Returns NULL on error.

## API: al_set_config_value

Set a value in a section of a configuration.  If the section doesn't yet
exist, it will be created.  If a value already existed for the given key,
it will be overwritten.
The section can be NULL or "" for the global section.

For consistency with the on-disk format of config files, any leading and
trailing whitespace will be stripped from the value.  If you have significant
whitespace you wish to preserve, you should add your own quote characters
and remove them when reading the values back in.

## API: al_save_config_file

Write out a configuration file to disk.
Returns zero on success, non-zero on error.
