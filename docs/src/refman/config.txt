# Configuration files


## API: ALLEGRO_CONFIG

## API: al_add_config_comment

Add a comment in a section of a configuration.  If the section doesn't yet
exist, it will be created.
The section can be NULL or "" for the global section.

The comment may or may not begin with a hash character.
Any newlines in the comment string will be replaced by space characters.

## API: al_add_config_section

Add a section to a configuration structure.

## API: al_create_config

Create an empty configuration structure.

## API: al_destroy_config

Free the resources used by a configuration structure.
Does nothing if passed NULL.

## API: al_get_config_value

Gets a pointer to an internal character buffer that will only remain valid
as long as the ALLEGRO_CONFIG structure is not destroyed. Copy the value
if you need a copy.
The section can be NULL or "" for the global section.
Returns NULL if the section or key do not exist.

## API: al_merge_config

Merge two configuration structures, and return the result as a new
configuration.  Values in configuration 'cfg2' override those in 'cfg1'.
Neither of the input configuration structures are
modified.
Comments from 'cfg2' are not retained.

## API: al_merge_config_into

Merge one configuration structure into another.
Values in configuration 'add' override those in 'master'.
'master' is modified.
Comments from 'add' are not retained.

## API: al_load_config_file

Read a configuration file from disk.
Returns NULL on error.

## API: al_set_config_value

Set a value in a section of a configuration.  If the section doesn't yet
exist, it will be created.  If a value already existed for the given key,
it will be overwritten.
The section can be NULL or "" for the global section.

For consistency with the on-disk format of config files, any leading and
trailing whitespace will be stripped from the value.  If you have significant
whitespace you wish to preserve, you should add your own quote characters
and remove them when reading the values back in.

## API: al_save_config_file

Write out a configuration file to disk.
Returns zero on success, non-zero on error.

## API: al_get_first_config_section

Returns the name of the first section in the given config file. Usually
this will return an empty string for the global section. The `iterator`
parameter will receive an opaque iterator which is used by
[al_get_next_config_section] to iterate over the remaining sections.

Note:
The returned string and the iterator are only valid as long as no
change is made to the passed ALLEGRO_CONFIG.

## API: al_get_next_config_section

Returns the name of the next section in the given config file. The
`iterator` must have been obtained with [al_get_first_config_section]
first.

## API: al_get_first_config_entry

Returns the name of the first key in the given section in the given
config. The `iterator` works like the one for
[al_get_first_config_section].

Note:
The returned string and the iterator are only valid as long as no
change is made to the passed ALLEGRO_CONFIG.

## API: al_get_next_config_entry

Returns the next key for the iterator obtained by
[al_get_first_config_entry];
