### API: al_draw_soft_triangle

Draws a triangle using the software rasterizer and user supplied pixel
functions. For help in understanding what these functions do, see the
implementation of the various shading routines in addons/primitives/tri_soft.c.
The triangle is drawn in two segments, from top to bottom. The segments are
deliniated by the vertically middle vertex of the triangle. One of each segment
may be absent if two vertices are horizontally collinear.

*Parameters:*

* v1, v2, v3 - The three vertices of the triangle
* state - A pointer to a user supplied struct, this struct will be passed to
  all the pixel functions
* init - This function is called once, before any drawing is done. The three
  points passed to it may be altered by clipping.
* first - The function is called twice, once per triangle segment. It is
  passed 4 parameters, the first two are the coordinates of the initial pixel
  drawn in the segment. 
  The second two are the left minor and the left major steps, respectively.
  They represent the sizes of two steps taken by the rasterizer as it walks
  on the left side of the triangle. From then on, the each step will either
  be classified as a minor or a major step, corresponding to the above
  values.
* step - Called once per scanline. The last parameter is set to 1 if the step
  is a minor step, and 0 if it is a major step.
* draw - Called once per scanline. The function is expected to draw the
  scanline starting with a point specified by the first two parameters
  (corresponding to x and y values) going to the right until it reaches the
  value of the third parameter (the x value of the end point). All coordinates
  are inclusive.

### API: al_draw_soft_line

Draws a line using the software rasterizer and user supplied pixel functions.
For help in understanding what these functions do, see the implementation of
the various shading routines in addons/primitives/line_soft.c.
The line is drawn top to bottom.

*Parameters:*

* v1, v2 - The two vertices of the line
* state - A pointer to a user supplied struct, this struct will be passed to
  all the pixel functions
* first - The function is called before drawing the first pixel of the line. It
  is passed the coordinates of this pixel, as well as the two vertices above.
  The passed vertices may have been altered by clipping.
* step - Called once per pixel. The second parameter is set to 1 if the step is
  a minor step, and 0 if this step is a major step. Minor steps are taken only
  either in x or y directions.
  Major steps are taken in both directions diagonally. In all cases, the the
  absolute value of the change in coordinate is at most 1 in either direction.
* draw - Called once per pixel. The function is expected to draw the pixel at
  the two coordinates passed to it.

## Transformations

### API: al_copy_transform

Makes a copy of a transformation.

*Parameters:*

* src - Source transformation
* dest - Destination transformation

### API: al_use_transform

Sets the transformation to be used for the primitive drawing operations. Every
drawing operation after this call will be transformed using this
transformation. Call this function with the identity before using non-primitive
drawing functions (e.g. drawing bitmaps), otherwise the behaviour of those
functions will not be defined.

*Parameters:*

* trans - Transformation to use

### API: al_get_current_transform

Returns the current transformation, as set by [al_use_transform].

*Returns:*
A pointer to the current transformation.

### API: al_invert_transform

Inverts the passed transformation. If the transformation is nearly singular 
(close to not having an inverse) then the returned transformation may be
invalid. Use [al_check_inverse] to assertain if the transformation has an
inverse if you are in doubt.

*Parameters:*

* trans - Transformation to invert

*See Also:*
[al_check_inverse]

### API: al_check_inverse

Checks if the transformation has an inverse using supplied tolerance. Tolerance
should be a small value between 0 and 1, with 0.001 being sufficient for most
applications. Note that this check is superfluous most of the time if you only
used the primitives addon to construct the transformation. The only thing that
would cause the transformation to not have an inverse is if you applied a 0 (or
very small) scale to the transformation. As long as the scale is comfortably
above 0, the transformation is invertible. This, of course, does not apply if
you manually fiddle with the values of the transformation.

*Parameters:*

* trans - Transformation to check
* tol - Tolerance

*Returns:*
1 if the transformation is invertible, 0 otherwise

*See Also:*
[al_invert_transform]

### API: al_identity_transform

Sets the transformation to be the identity transformation.

*Parameters:*

* trans - Transformation to alter

### API: al_build_transform

Builds a transformation given some parameters. This call is equivalent to
calling the transformations in this order: make identity, scale, rotate,
translate. This method is faster, however.

*Parameters:*

* trans - Transformation to alter
* x, y - Translation
* sx, sy - Scale
* theta - Rotation angle

### API: al_translate_transform

Apply a translation to a transformation.

*Parameters:*

* trans - Transformation to alter
* x, y - Translation

### API: al_rotate_transform

Apply a rotation to a transformation.

*Parameters:*

* trans - Transformation to alter
* theta - Rotation angle

### API: al_scale_transform

Apply a scale to a transformation.

*Parameters:*

* trans - Transformation to alter
* sx, sy - Scale

### API: al_transform_vertex

Transform a vertex.

*Parameters:*

* trans - Transformation to use
* vtx - Vertex to transform

### API: al_transform_transform

Transform a transformation.

*Parameters:*

* trans - Transformation to use
* trans2 - Transformation to transform

## Structures and types

### API: ALLEGRO_PRIM_COLOR

A special structure that defines a color in a way that understandable to both
OpenGL and Direct3D backends.
You should never access internal fields, instead using the two conversion
functions to convert between it and [ALLEGRO_COLOR] structure.

*See Also:*
[al_get_allegro_color], [al_get_prim_color]

### API: ALLEGRO_VERTEX

Defines the generic vertex type, with a 2D position, color and texture
coordinates for a single texture.

*Fields:*

* x, y - Position of the vertex.
* color - `ALLEGRO_PRIM_COLOR` structure
* u, v - Texture coordinates

*See Also:*
[ALLEGRO_PRIM_COLOR]

### API: ALLEGRO_TRANSFORM

Defines the generic transformation type, a 4x4 matrix. 2D transforms use only
a small subsection of this matrix, namely the top left 2x2 matrix, and the
right most 2x1 matrix, for a total of 6 values.

*Fields:*

* m - A 4x4 float matrix

### API: ALLEGRO_VERTEX_DECL

A vertex declaration. This opaque structure is responsible for describing
the format and layout of a user defined custom vertex. It is created and 
destroyed by specialized functions.

*See Also:*
[al_create_vertex_decl], [al_destroy_vertex_decl], [ALLEGRO_VERTEX_ELEMENT]

### API: ALLEGRO_VERTEX_ELEMENT

A small structure describing a certain element of a vertex. E.g. the
position of the vertex, or its color. These structures are used by the 
al_create_vertex_decl function to create the vertex declaration. For that they
generally occur in an array. The last element of such an array should have the 
attribute field be 0, to signify that it is the end of the array.
Here's an example of code that would create a declaration describing the 
ALLEGRO_VERTEX structure:

    ALLEGRO_VERTEX_ELEMENT elems[] = {
       {ALLEGRO_PRIM_POSITION, ALLEGRO_PRIM_FLOAT_2, offsetof(ALLEGRO_VERTEX, x)},
       {ALLEGRO_PRIM_TEX_COORD, ALLEGRO_PRIM_FLOAT_2, offsetof(ALLEGRO_VERTEX, u)},
       {ALLEGRO_PRIM_COLOR_ATTR, 0, offsetof(CUSTOM_VERTEX, color)},
       {0, 0, 0}
    };
    ALLEGRO_VERTEX_DECL* decl = al_create_vertex_decl(elems, sizeof(ALLEGRO_VERTEX));

*Fields:*

* attribute - A member of the ALLEGRO_PRIM_ATTR enumeration, specifying what
   this attribute signifies
* storage - A member of the ALLEGRO_PRIM_STORAGE enumeration, specifying how
   this attribute is stored
* offset - Offset in bytes from the beginning of the custom vertex structure. C
   function offsetof is very useful here.

*See Also:*
[al_create_vertex_decl], [ALLEGRO_VERTEX_DECL], [ALLEGRO_PRIM_STORAGE]

### API: ALLEGRO_PRIM_TYPE

Enumerates the types of primitives this addon can draw.

* ALLEGRO_PRIM_LINE_LIST - A list of lines, sequential pairs of vertices define
  disjointed lines

* ALLEGRO_PRIM_LINE_STRIP - A strip of lines, sequential vertices define a
  strip of lines

* ALLEGRO_PRIM_LINE_LOOP - Like a line strip, except at the end the first and
  the last vertices are also connected by a line

* ALLEGRO_PRIM_TRIANGLE_LIST - A list of triangles, sequential triplets of
  vertices define disjointed triangles

* ALLEGRO_PRIM_TRIANGLE_STRIP - A strip of triangles, sequential vertices
  define a strip of triangles

* ALLEGRO_PRIM_TRIANGLE_FAN - A fan of triangles, all triangles share the first
  vertex

### API: ALLEGRO_PRIM_ATTR

Enumerates the types of vertex attributes that a custom vertex may have.

* ALLEGRO_PRIM_POSITION - Position information, can be stored in any supported 
   fashion

* ALLEGRO_PRIM_COLOR_ATTR - Color information, stored in an ALLEGRO_PRIM_COLOR.
   The storage field of ALLEGRO_VERTEX_ELEMENT is ignored

* ALLEGRO_PRIM_TEX_COORD - Texture coordinate information, can be stored only in
   ALLEGRO_PRIM_FLOAT_2 and ALLEGRO_PRIM_SHORT_2

*See Also:*
[ALLEGRO_VERTEX_DECL], [ALLEGRO_PRIM_STORAGE]

### API: ALLEGRO_PRIM_STORAGE

Enumerates the types of storage an attribute of a custom vertex may be stored
in.

* ALLEGRO_PRIM_FLOAT_2 - A doublet of floats
* ALLEGRO_PRIM_FLOAT_3 - A triplet of floats
* ALLEGRO_PRIM_SHORT_2 - A doublet of shorts

*See Also:*
[ALLEGRO_PRIM_ATTR]

### API: ALLEGRO_VERTEX_CACHE_SIZE

Defines the size of the transformation vertex cache for the software renderer.
If you pass less than this many vertices to the primitive rendering functions
you will get a speed boost. This also defines the size of the cache vertex
buffer, used for the high-level primitives. This corresponds to the maximum
number of line segments that will be used to form them.

### API: ALLEGRO_PRIM_QUALITY

Defines the quality of the quadratic primitives. At 10, this roughly
corresponds to error < 0.5 pixel.
