/* This is just a quick hack. But good enough for our use of displaying
 * a short intro video when our game starts up - so might as well share
 * it.
 * 
 * Known bugs:
 * 
 * - Only very crude synching. Audio is slightly delayed and some
 *   videos seem to constantly drift off and then the audio gets all
 *   distorted...
 *
 * - Seeking/Pausing doesn't really work.
 * 
 * - Memory leaks. Easy to fix but don't have time right now.
 *
 * Missing features:
 * 
 * - Stream information. For example allow selection of one of several
 *   audio streams or subtitle overlay streams.
 * 
 * - Non audio/video streams. For example something like:
 *   ALLEGRO_USTR *al_get_video_subtitle(float *x, float *y);
 * 
 * - Buffering. Right now buffering is hardcoded to a fixed size which
 *   seemed enough for streaming 720p from disk in my tests. Obviously
 *   when streaming higher bandwidth or from a source with high
 *   fluctuation like an internet stream this won't work at all.
 * 
 * - Provide an audio stream for the audio. Then could use this to
 *   stream audio files. Right now opening an .mp3 with the video
 *   addon will play it but only with the video API instead of Allegro's
 *   normal audio streaming API...
 * 
 * - Audio/Video sync. For a game user-controlled sync is probably not
 *   too important as it can just ship with a properly synchronizeded
 *   video. However right now the audio delay is completely ignored.
 * 
 * - Additional drivers. Also redo the API a bit so not everything
 *   has to be done by the driver.
