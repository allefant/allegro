* Fix fstat and related struct and functions - /done sorta/ see below
* Fix mktemp - DONE 02-12-2006
* look at the path/drive sep and path conversion funcs to see if they should stay as is. - Yup, and DONE 02-12-2006

* fix the exists functions, this is part of the stat problem
  * maybe provide a is_* and a "exists()" set of functions.

* finish fname - DONE 02-12-2006

// 03-12-2006
* Change AL_FILE/AL_DIR to a merged AL_FS_ENTRY - DONE
* Add solitary stat info functions: each calls stat, if you want something more efficient, create a AL_FS_ENTRY handle.
  - al_fs_stat_size, al_fs_stat_mode, al_fs_stat_atime, etc
  - DONE

* char ** al_fs_find_ex(char *path, int (*filter)(...), void *filter_dat, int (*sort)(...), void *sort_dat);
* char ** al_fs_find(char *path, AL_FS_FILTER filter, AL_FS_SORT sort);
* void al_fs_free_list(char **);
* AL_FS_SORT::IgnoreCase is default aka: AL_FS_SORT::CaseSensitive needs to be passed, and IgnoreCase aught not to exist ;)

// 18-06-2008
* need to ensure the various uconvert stuff is correct
* MacOSX get_path implementation needed

// 13-09-2008
* maybe add a al_fs_set_interface(AL_FS_HOOK_SYS_VTABLE *, AL_FS_HOOK_ENTRY_VTABLE *) function
* finish stdio driver
* finish path.c/h functions
* get allegro to use fshook functions
* split old pack_ and datafile functions off into addons

// 18-09-2008
* probably need to do something about the fancy path.c parsing,
   in the demo I really don't want it to see A5TERIOIDS last item as a file if its not followed by a /
   and I dont really want to force the / either. the separate drive and file items are really convenient...
   but are they convenient enough to not be annoying in the case where you don't want them?
* AL_USER_DATA_PATH needs to be "fixed", currently I've hacked it to clone USER_HOME_PATH on unix, which is ok for now,
   wanted it to pre append the "app name" to it, so the app doesn't have to...
